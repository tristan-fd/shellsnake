# shellsnake
a minimalistic snake game for the shell coded in c.  
With this project, I wanted to practice using two-dimensional arrays.
I also learned how to use the ncurses library, which allows capturing user input continuously while the program is running.  
This program was coded on Linux and may not function correctly on Windows.

see html/index.html for documentation
